<h2>Four New Pocket Gophers<br />
of the Genus Cratogeomys from Jalisco, Mexico
</h2>

<p class="center">By<br /><br />

ROBERT J. RUSSELL</p>


<p>In the course of my taxonomic study of the genus <i>Cratogeomys</i>,
a high degree of variation was found between several populations
of these gophers in central Jalisco. Two species, <i>C. gymnurus</i> and
<i>C. zinseri</i>, occur in this part of the state. Previously <i>C. gymnurus</i>
was known only from southern Jalisco and <i>C. zinseri</i> only from
extreme eastern Jalisco, but through the efforts of J. R. Alcorn
specimens were obtained of both species in the central part of the
state. These large gophers are difficult to collect, and I am grateful
to him for securing this significant material. Costs of the field
work were defrayed by the National Science Foundation and the
Kansas University Endowment Association. Thanks are due also
to those in charge of the United States Biological Surveys Collection
for the loan of comparative material. Study of the recently acquired
specimens taken in central Jalisco reveals two undescribed
subspecies each of <i>C. gymnurus</i> and <i>C. zinseri</i>. These may be
known and described as</p>


<h3><b>Cratogeomys gymnurus tellus</b> new subspecies</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 33454 Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.
Kansas; from 3 mi. W Tala, 4300 ft., Jalisco, M&eacute;xico; obtained on June 2, 1949,
by J. R. Alcorn, original No. 9376.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;North-central Jalisco; known from several localities in the vicinity
of Tala.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements); tail long, naked; hind foot
small; color pale for species, upper parts Kaiser Brown (capitalized terms are
of Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
1912), bases of individual hairs Plumbeous, tips Hazel, underparts creamy-white,
bases of hairs Plumbeous; skull large, relatively narrow, rugose; zygomatic
breadth narrower posteriorly than anteriorly; rostrum shallow, relatively
broad in males, narrower in females; interorbital region broad; braincase
narrow and flattened; basioccipital relatively wide, especially anteriorly; mastoid
processes of squamosal large, knoblike; paroccipital processes long, extending
laterally over more than half the width of mastoid bullae; upper
incisors projecting anteriorly; maxillary teeth relatively large.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>C. g. gymnurus</i> from Zapotlan, Jalisco,
the most closely related subspecies, <i>C. g. tellus</i> differs in: Body smaller (total
length averaging 338 instead of 341 in females and 356 instead of 369 in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
males); hind foot smaller (averaging 45 instead of 50 in females and 47 instead
of 51 in males); color more brownish above, creamy-white rather than
buffy below; skull smaller, especially in females (basilar length averaging 55.3
instead of 57.5 in females and 57.7 instead of 60.5 in males), narrower, and
more rugose; zygomatic breadth less in females (averaging 42.5 compared
with 46.2), greater in males (48.0 compared with 46.7); zygomata more nearly
parallel; auditory bullae relatively smaller; mastoid processes of squamosal
larger, knoblike; paroccipital processes longer, extending farther laterally; rostrum
less massive; upper incisors projecting anteriorly, instead of being strongly
recurved; maxillary teeth relatively larger.</p>

<p>From near-topotypes of <i>C. g. inclarus</i> from the Sierra Nevada de Colima,
Jalisco, <i>C. g. tellus</i> differs in: Hind foot smaller; color paler brownish above
in contrast to glossy black, creamy-white below rather than buffy, feet clothed
with whitish instead of brownish hairs; skull larger (basilar length averaging
55.3 in females compared with 53.2, no males available for comparisons);
zygomatic breadth less; nasals longer, extending posterior to front edge of
anterior roots of zygomata rather than ending even with, or slightly behind,
them; rostrum more massive; mastoid processes of squamosal larger; paroccipital
processes extending farther laterally; upper incisors projecting anteriorly, rather
than recurved; maxillary teeth larger (length of maxillary tooth-row averaging
14.6 compared with 13.3).</p>

<p>Close comparison with <i>C. g. imparilis</i> from P&aacute;tzcuaro, Michoac&aacute;n, is not
needed, <i>but C. g. tellus</i> differs especially in: Color of underparts and hairs of
feet whitish rather than brownish; skull smaller; zygomatic breadth greater;
interorbital constriction broader; nasals longer; maxillary tooth-row longer.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Averages of three adult females, including type, and the
measurements of an adult male (in parentheses) from the type locality are:
Total length, 338 (356); length of tail, 92 (87); length of hind foot, 45 (47);
occipitonasal length of skull, 64.1 (68.7); basilar length, 55.3 (61.4); zygomatic
breadth, 42.7 (48.0); interorbital breadth, 9.6 (11.4); greatest height
of cranium, taken from palate perpendicular to line touching two highest points
on top of skull, 23.9 (25.3); least depth of rostrum, 10.6 (11.7); breadth of
rostrum, 14.7 (16.5); length of nasals, 23.6 (25.2); width across mastoid
processes of squamosal, 43.8 (49.7); height of occiput, 18.1 (19.9); length of
maxillary tooth-row, 14.6 (15.2).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The distribution of <i>C. gymnurus</i> is spotty; its occurrence seemingly
depends on edaphic conditions. The isolation of soils with textures
suitable to this animal has resulted in the isolation of gopher populations. The
distribution is similar to that of species occurring on islands. In this instance,
however, the populations of gophers are separated by soils of heavy texture
which render burrowing difficult or impossible for gophers. Such conditions
have led to a high degree of subspeciation in a relatively short distance. For
example, four subspecies of <i>C. gymnurus</i> occur in Jalisco, and, all are within
an area scarcely fifty miles in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Cratogeomys gymnurus tellus</i> is the northernmost subspecies of <i>C. gymnurus</i>.
It is known from only the vicinity of Tala, west of Guadalajara, and its range
probably is not much more extensive than this because of the localized distribution
of suitable soils.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total number ten, as follows: 3 mi. W Tala, type
locality, 5; 1 mi. NE Tala, 3; 1 mi. S El Refugio, 2.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>

<h3><b>Cratogeomys gymnurus atratus</b> new subspecies</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 31880 Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.
Kansas; from Top of Cerro Viejo de Cuyutl&aacute;n, 9700 ft., 19 mi. S and 9 mi. W
Guadalajara, Jalisco, M&eacute;xico; obtained on February 17, 1949, by J. R. Alcorn,
original No. 7902.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality on the Cerro Viejo.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small (see measurements); tail long; hind foot small; color
dark, upper parts glossy Blackish Brown, bases of hairs Plumbeous, sides
Chestnut Brown, underparts Pale Ochraceous-Buff or Warm Buff mixed with
Plumbeous of the hair bases; skull small, lightly constructed, relatively deep;
zygomata relatively weak; zygomatic breadth wider posteriorly than anteriorly;
rostrum relatively wide, especially in males; nasals relatively long, truncate
posteriorly; interorbital constriction narrow; braincase inflated; mastoid processes
of squamosal only slightly wider than zygomatic breadth; auditory bullae relatively
large; paroccipital processes weakly constructed, but extend laterally
over half the width of mastoid bullae; upper incisors projecting anteriorly,
rather than being strongly recurved; maxillary teeth small.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>C. g. gymnurus</i> from Zapotlan, Jalisco,
<i>C. g. atratus</i> differs in: Body smaller (total length averaging 300 in females
compared with 341, a male measured 315 compared with an average of 363);
tail shorter, hind foot smaller; color of upper parts darker, glossy Blackish-Brown
rather than reddish brown, underparts paler; skull smaller (basilar
length averaging 48.6 compared with 57.5, a male measured 50.0 compared
with an average of 59.0); zygomata more weakly constructed; zygomatic
breadth less, and wider posteriorly than anteriorly; braincase more inflated;
nasals shorter; rostrum relatively narrower and shallower; width across mastoid
processes of squamosals less; paroccipital processes less strongly constructed,
extending farther laterally; upper incisors projecting anteriorly rather than being
strongly recurved; maxillary teeth smaller (length of maxillary tooth-row averaging
11.2 compared with 14.9).</p>

<p>From <i>C. g. tellus</i>, that occurs to the northwest, <i>C. g. atratus</i> differs in: Body
smaller; hind foot slightly smaller; upper parts darker; underparts Pale
Ochraceous-Buff rather than creamy-white; skull smaller (see measurements);
zygomatic breadth less, and wider posteriorly than anteriorly; nasals shorter,
truncate posteriorly rather than emarginate; rostrum narrower and shallower;
maxillary teeth smaller.</p>

<p>From near-topotypes of <i>C. g. inclarus</i> from the Sierra Nevada de Colima,
<i>C. g. atratus</i> differs in: Body slightly smaller; hind foot smaller (averaging 42
compared with 49); color of upper parts near the same, underparts paler;
skull smaller, narrower, weaker in construction; zygomatic breadth less; nasals
relatively longer, but actually shorter (averaging 19.7 compared with 20.3);
upper incisors projecting anteriorly rather than being recurved; maxillary teeth
smaller.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The type and an adult female (its measurements in parentheses)
yield measurements as follows: Total length, 300 (299); length of tail,
78 (83); length of hind foot, 43 (40); occipitonasal length of skull, 56.3
(55.5); basilar length, 49.3 (47.8); zygomatic breadth, 37.9 (36.5); interorbital
breadth, 8.7 (8.1); greatest height of cranium, as explained above,
21.6 (20.7); least depth of rostrum, 9.2 (8.8); breadth of rostrum, 12.8 (12.7);<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
length of nasals, 19.4 (20.0); width across mastoid processes of squamosal,
38.2 (37.1); height of occiput, 16.9 (17.3); length of maxillary tooth-row,
11.9 (11.3).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Cratogeomys gymnurus atratus</i> is the smallest subspecies known
for the species, and is so distinct from other described subspecies, that it is
difficult to select one as the closest relative. In color, <i>C. g. atratus</i> closely
resembles <i>C. g. inclarus</i>, which occurs at comparable elevations in the Sierra
Nevada, but the skulls are unlike. Among named subspecies of <i>C. gymnurus</i>,
the skull of <i>tellus</i> most closely resembles that of <i>atratus</i>, and, although they
differ greatly in size, <i>C. g. tellus</i> seems to be the closest relative of <i>C. g. atratus</i>.</p>

<p>This newly described subspecies is known only from Cerro Viejo and is
probably restricted to the higher elevations on this mountain.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Seven, Top of Cerro Viejo de Cuyutl&aacute;n, 19 mi. S and
9 mi. W Guadalajara.</p></div>


<h3><b>Cratogeomys zinseri zodius</b> new subspecies</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skull and skin, No. 31879 Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas;
from 13 mi. S and 15 mi. W Guadalajara, Jalisco, M&eacute;xico; obtained on February
6, 1949, by J. R. Alcorn, original No. 7747.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small (see measurements); tail short; hind foot small;
upper parts Sayal Brown, underparts Pinkish Buff, hind foot whitish; skull
small, narrow; outline of dorsal profile of skull concave; zygomatic breadth
narrow; nasals actually short, but relatively long; width across mastoid processes
of squamosal short; auditory bullae inflated; interorbital constriction narrow;
maxillary teeth relatively large.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>C. z. zinseri</i> from Lagos, Jalisco, <i>C. z.
zodius</i> differs in: Body smaller (see measurements); tail shorter, hind foot
smaller; upper parts dull brownish instead of reddish-brown, underparts paler,
hairs of feet whitish instead of brownish; skull smaller, especially in females,
narrower; dorsal profile of skull concave or flat (females) rather than convex;
zygomatic breadth less; rostrum narrower and shallower; nasals actually shorter,
but relatively longer in relation to length of skull; width across mastoid
processes of squamosal shorter; maxillary teeth smaller.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The type and an adult male (his measurements in parentheses)
yield measurements as follows: Total length, 318 (324); length of
tail, 95 (89); length of hind foot, 41 (41); occipitonasal length of skull, 60.5
(59.1); basilar length, 52.4 (51.8); zygomatic breadth, 40.6 (39.0); interorbital
breadth, 8.3 (8.8); greatest height of cranium, as explained above,
22.6 (22.4); least depth of rostrum, 11.2 (10.4); breadth of rostrum, 13.3
(13.9); length of nasals, 21.7 (21.2); width across mastoid processes of squamosal,
37.1 (36.8); height of occiput, 17.7 (17.9); length of maxillary tooth-row,
13.0 (13.3). A nearly adult female measured: Total length, 292; length
of tail, 81; length of hind foot, 39; occipitonasal length of skull, 53.3; basilar
length, 46.5; zygomatic breadth, 34.1; interorbital breadth, 7.8; greatest height
of cranium, 21.0; least depth of rostrum, 9.8; length of nasals, 18.0; width
across mastoid processes of squamosal, 32.2; depth of occiput, 15.9; length of
maxillary tooth-row, 12.1.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This newly described subspecies is the smallest of known races
of <i>C. zinseri</i>, and it is seemingly more closely related to <i>C. z. zinseri</i> than to the
subspecies newly named below from the north end of Lago Sayula. The skulls
of females are especially small and delicate in structure; the males are larger
with more massive skulls. <i>C. z. zodius</i> is known to occur in the foot hills north
of the Cerro Viejo, the mountain from which <i>C. g. atratus</i> was described above.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Seven, 13 mi. S and 15 mi. W Guadalajara.</p></div>


<h3><b>Cratogeomys zinseri morulus</b> new subspecies</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skull and skin, No. 36679 Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas;
from N end Lago Sayula, 4400 ft., 9 mi. N and 2 mi. E Atoyac, Jalisco, M&eacute;xico;
obtained on March 23, 1950, by J. R. Alcorn, original No. 10889.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality in central Jalisco.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements); tail short; hind foot large; upper
parts Fuscous-Black, strongly mixed with Walnut Brown, underparts Cinnamon-Buff,
bases of all hairs Plumbeous; skull large, broad, rugose; outline of dorsal
profile slightly concave, almost flat; zygomata strongly constructed, maxillary
arm almost touching squamosal arm over jugal; wide across zygomata; nasals
actually and relatively long; rostrum relatively narrow; auditory bullae inflated,
relatively large; maxillary teeth relatively large.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>C. z. zinseri</i> from Lagos, Jalisco, <i>C. z.
morulus</i> differs in: Tail shorter (averaging 96 in females compared with 101,
94 in males compared with 115); color darker above, Fuscous-Black instead of
Cinnamon-Rufous, underparts paler; skull larger (occipitonasal length 63.7
rather than averaging 58.5 in females and 68.6 rather than 63.1 in males);
wide across zygomata; nasals actually and relatively longer; rostrum relatively
narrower; wider across mastoid processes of squamosal; auditory bullae inflated,
relatively larger; maxillary teeth larger.</p>

<p>From <i>C. z. zodius</i>, that occurs to the northeast, <i>C. z. morulus</i> differs in:

from the type locality measure: Total length, 358 (338); length of
tail, 94 (97); length of hind foot, 49 (45); occipitonasal length of skull, 68.6
(63.7); basilar length, 58.0 (55.6); zygomatic breadth, 49.3 (45.0); interorbital
breadth, 9.6 (8.9); greatest height of cranium, as explained above,
26.1 (24.6); least depth of rostrum, 12.5 (10.8); breadth of rostrum, 14.5
(13.7); length of nasals, 25.9 (22.5); width across mastoid processes of squamosal,
47.7 (42.8); height of occiput, 19.8 (17.8); length of maxillary tooth-row,
13.9 (13.8).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Cratogeomys zinseri morulus</i> is the darkest subspecies known of
<i>C. zinseri</i>. It differs widely from other subspecies of this species in color and
the large size of the skull.</p>

<p><i>Cratogeomys zinseri</i> occurs over the same general area as <i>C. gymnurus</i> in
central Jalisco, although these two species seemingly do not share the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
local habitat. <i>C. zinseri</i> differs from <i>C. gymnurus</i> as follows: Tail relatively
longer; skull wider across zygomatic arches than across mastoid processes of
squamosal (reverse true in <i>C. gymnurus</i>); zygomata strongly bowed outward
anteriorly; maxillary arm of zygomata almost touching squamosal arm (instead
of widely separated from each other) above jugal; rostrum relatively narrower,
less massive; border of nasals parallel or laterally swollen instead of gradually
tapering.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Four, N end of Lago Sayula, 9 mi. N and 2 mi. E
Atoyac.</p></div>
